We are building a "gas bad" marketplace. An NFT marketplace, but we are going for a gas optimized version. 

To do this, we are writing 2 types of smart contracts:

1. Reference contracts in solidity 
2. Optimized contracts in solidity / assembly 

We will be deploying `GasBadNftMarketplace.sol` to the Ethereum mainnet, but are using `NftMarketplace.sol` as a reference point.

# About

We are building a "gas bad" marketplace. An NFT marketplace, but we are going for a gas optimized version. 

To do this, we are writing 2 types of smart contracts:

1. Reference contracts in solidity 
2. Optimized contracts in solidity / assembly 

We will be deploying `GasBadNftMarketplace.sol` to the Ethereum mainnet, but are using `NftMarketplace.sol` as a reference point. 

# Getting Started

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `forge --version` and you see a response like `forge 0.2.0 (816e00b 2023-03-16T00:05:26.396218Z)`
- [certoraRun cli](https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/docs/user-guide/getting-started/install.html)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `certoraRun --version` and you see a response like `certora-cli 6.1.4`
  - You'll also need a certora environment variable named `CERTORAKEY`
  - You may need python and `pip` installed to install the certora cli

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/Cyfrin/12-gas-bad-nft-marketplace-audit
cd 12-gas-bad-nft-marketplace-audit
make
```

# Usage

## Certora


### Certora Setup

After installing the [Certora CLI](https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/docs/user-guide/getting-started/install.html), you'll need to set up your environment variables. The instructions here only work for linux/macOs/windows WSL.

```bash
export CERTORAKEY=<personal_access_key>
```

or, you can ruh:

```
source .env.example
```

You can check if the environment variable is set by running:

```bash
echo $CERTORAKEY
```

### Running Certora 

In this repo, we will be heavily relying on Certora to make sure our codebase is good! We have the following specs:
- `GasBadNft.spec`: For formally verifying the `GasBadNftContract.sol`
- `NftMock.spec`: For showcasing some cool Certora functionality ðŸ˜Š 

The two main commands to run the specs, respectively are:

```
make certora
make certoraNft
```

See the `Makefile` for more details.

## Testing

```
forge test
```

### Test Coverage

```
forge coverage
```

and for coverage based testing:

```
forge coverage --report debug
```
