# About

# Getting Started

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `forge --version` and you see a response like `forge 0.2.0 (816e00b 2023-03-16T00:05:26.396218Z)`
- [python3 & pip3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `python3 --version` and you see a response like `Python 3.x.x`
  - [Halmos](https://github.com/a16z/halmos)
    - To know you've installed it run `halmos --version` and you should see something like `halmos 0.1.0 (816e00b 2023-03-16T00:05:26.396218Z)
  - [certoraRun](https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/docs/user-guide/getting-started/install.html)
    - You'll know you did it right if you can run `certoraRun --version` and you get an output like: `certora-cli 6.3.1`

*Note: I like to install `certoraRun` and `halmos` using [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) instead of `pip`.*
